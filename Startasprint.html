			 <h4 class="title"><b><p> Setting up a Sprint </p></b></h4>
			 <p> You set up a sprint in two parts. In <b>part one</b> the Product Owner and Team look at the high priority items from the Backlog, they discuss the goals and context for these items, and they review the ‘definition of Done’ that had been discussed beforehand. Part one of the sprint is understanding what the Product Owner wants. After part one, the product owner can choose to leave but must always be available (for example by phone). </p>
			 <p>In <b>part two</b> of the sprint the focus is on detailed task planning of the items the team will work on for that sprint. They commit to finishing the items of the backlog they selected by the end of this sprint, starting with the highest priority. The key to Scrum is: the team itself can select how much they take on within a sprint, based on how much they think they can complete, the Product Owner does not decide this for them. Sprint Planning Meetings can last a number of hours, but no more than 8 for a four-week sprint. Next to this, the team members update each other daily, and a team member adds the hours remaining on the Sprint burndown chart. At the end of a sprint they have to move on to new items. </p> </h4>

			 <h4 class="title"><b><p> The Sprint Burndown Chart </p></b></h4>
		<p> Every day the teams updates each other on the estimated time needed to finish the current sprints tasks into the Sprint Backlog. With these hours, one team member adds them up for the team as a whole, and creates the Sprint Burndown Chart <i>(example below)</i>. Each day a new estimation of how many hours of work remain until the Team’s tasks are finished. The ideal line of this is downward sloping to reach ‘zero effort remaining’ meaning that there are no items left to do from the sprint. This effect is called Burndown, therefore the burndown chart. It shows the progress towards the goal, not by how many hours there have been spent, but how many remain in the future, and what separates the team from their goal. </p>
